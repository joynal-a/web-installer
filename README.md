## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Laravel version 10.x or newer.

### Installation

1. Add the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require joynala/web-installer
```

2. Publish the package's resources:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=web-installer-config
```

3. In your `AppServiceProvider`, in the `boot` method, add:

```php
if(!$this->app->runningInConsole()){
    if (!file_exists(base_path('storage/installed')) && !request()->is('install') && !request()->is('install/*')) {
        header("Location: install");
        exit;
    }
}
```

## 🛡️ Envato Purchase Check

Keep your app safe from unauthorized use by turning on Envato purchase checks.

### Configuration

Find these settings in `config/installer.php`:

```php
'product' => '', // Your product's name.
'verify_code' => '', // A secret code.
'verify_purchase' => true, // Turn on purchase checks.
'verify_rules' => [
    // Rules for checking.
]
```

### 🎭 Keeping Your Code Safe

After checking:

1. Use `php artisan make:json your file directory` to create a JSON file.
2. Store this file on your secure server.
3. Give users access and directions after they pass the check:

- the response for 200 status
```php
[
    'permission' => true,
    'restore' => [
        [
            'dir' => 'e.g., routes/web.php',
            'source_code' => file_get_contents('path/to/your/json'),
        ],
    ]
]
```

- the response for 422 status
```php
[
    'permission' => false,
    'message' => 'You provide a wrong purchase code.'
]
```
